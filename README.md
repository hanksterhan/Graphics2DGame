# Graphics2DGame
A small 2D game inspired by Gem Swap, Space Invaders, or Lunar Lander.

I have completed:
- grid
- swap
- bomb
- skyfall
- quake (limited to 100 frames, each gem has 0.1% chance of disappearing - hard to see)
- turn (mouse functionality is buggy, but keys A&D rotate the camera perspective)
- Three in a line (buggy)
- legal (very buggy, mainly after the first legal swap)
- sticky (activated when holding down the key Z because sticky is buggy)

I attempted dramatic exit (attempted but couldn't figure out a way to slowly exit without exhausting my GPU)
